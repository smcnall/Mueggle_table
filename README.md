Microbiome Dataset:
A dataset given to me by Dr. Thomas Sharpton of Oregon State University. The dataset contains the counts 
of 25092 OTU's in a variety of different environments. The bits of code are an attempt to find correlations 
between the relative abudances and genetic diversity of these microbiomes.
